##  Project Overview
House Rent Prediction in India is a machine learning project that aims to predict the rental price of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and furnishing status.  
The project is implemented using Python and the Scikit-Learn library and demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model prediction.

This project helps in understanding rental trends and how machine learning models can be used for real-world price prediction problems.

##  Objectives
- To analyze house rent data in India
- To preprocess and clean the dataset
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- To train a machine learning regression model
- To predict house rent prices based on input features

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

##  Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection and encoding  
5. Model training using regression algorithms  
6. Model evaluation  
7. Rent price prediction

## Output

The trained machine learning model predicts the estimated house rent based on the provided property details.
The results help in understanding how different features affect rental prices.

## Program Information

This project was developed as part of the EDUNET Foundation Program for academic learning and hands-on experience in machine learning.
